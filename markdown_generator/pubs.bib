  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is raging. It revealed the importance of rapid scientific advancement towards understanding and treating new diseases. To address this challenge, we adapt an explainable artificial intelligence algorithm for data fusion and utilize it on new omics data on viral–host interactions, human protein interactions, and drugs to better understand SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and predict new drug–target interactions for COVID-19. We discover that in the human interactome, the human proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the genes that are differentially expressed after the infection have common neighbors central in the interactome that may be key to the disease mechanisms. We uncover 185 new drug–target interactions targeting 49 of these key genes and suggest re-purposing of 149 FDA-approved drugs, including drugs targeting VEGF and nitric oxide signaling, whose pathways coincide with the observed COVID-19 symptoms. Our integrative methodology is universal and can enable insight into this and other serious diseases.},

  abstract = {Stroke produces immense health and economic burdens globally. Stroke survivors typically have paralysis and/or balance problems. They receive impaired proprioceptive feedback to maintain a correct posture as well as other feedback from therapists during rehabilitation. In this scenario, wearable technologies properly configured by therapists can help people who have sustained stroke get this feedback during outpatient rehabilitation. In this paper, we focus on stroke survivors with upper-limp impairment and propose a hierarchical approach aimed at monitoring arm movements through inertial sensors. The approach is composed of two levels that work sequentially: the upper level distinguishes between arm movements and non-movements and the lower level recognizes between purposeful and non-purposeful movements. With the aim of providing this solution at stroke survivors׳ home, first experiments have been performed in the lab with 21 volunteers (15 healthy and 6 who suffered a stroke) wearing a wristband on each wrist. Besides walking (non-purposeful movement), five activities in which the arm has to be purposefully activated have been performed (purposeful movement): eating; pouring water; drinking; teeth brushing; and folding a towel. Results show that, at training time, both modules obtained high performances. At testing time, the best configuration of the system has been tested on two datasets with healthy volunteers (intra- and inter-subjects). Also in these cases, high accuracy and F1-score were obtained. Acc=0.91 and F1=0.91 on the intra-subject dataset; and Acc=0.90 and F1=0.90 in the inter-subject one. Moreover, promising results were obtained at both training and testing time using end users׳ data (i.e., people who suffered a stroke). Results at testing time are Acc=0.79 and F1=0.79.}
