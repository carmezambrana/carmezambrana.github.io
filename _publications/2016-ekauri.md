In elderly care, activities of daily living are used to assess cognitive and physical capabilities of people. In fact, cognitive and physical decline may start with problems in doing daily living activities. Elderly people may not be able to complete an activity by themselves or the activity takes more time than usual. Moreover, forgetting to do some daily activity may indicate diseases that affect memory. Sleep disorders represent a very common problem for elderly people and may influence the overall quality of life. In this paper, we focus on sleeping and propose a study aimed at recognize this kind of activity. The goal is twofold; on the one hand, to monitor elderly people at their home to give assistance in case of needs; on the other hand, to give a support to therapists, caregivers, and familiars to become aware of the health status of the monitored elderly people and to receive alarms and alerts in case anomalies are detected. Experiments, performed with volunteers at their homes, show that the proposed approach is able to recognize sleeping activities with high accuracy.
