Stroke produces immense health and economic burdens globally. Stroke survivors typically have paralysis and/or balance problems. They receive impaired proprioceptive feedback to maintain a correct posture as well as other feedback from therapists during rehabilitation. In this scenario, wearable technologies properly configured by therapists can help people who have sustained stroke get this feedback during outpatient rehabilitation. In this paper, we focus on stroke survivors with upper-limp impairment and propose a hierarchical approach aimed at monitoring arm movements through inertial sensors. The approach is composed of two levels that work sequentially: the upper level distinguishes between arm movements and non-movements and the lower level recognizes between purposeful and non-purposeful movements. With the aim of providing this solution at stroke survivors׳ home, first experiments have been performed in the lab with 21 volunteers (15 healthy and 6 who suffered a stroke) wearing a wristband on each wrist. Besides walking (non-purposeful movement), five activities in which the arm has to be purposefully activated have been performed (purposeful movement): eating; pouring water; drinking; teeth brushing; and folding a towel. Results show that, at training time, both modules obtained high performances. At testing time, the best configuration of the system has been tested on two datasets with healthy volunteers (intra- and inter-subjects). Also in these cases, high accuracy and F1-score were obtained. Acc=0.91 and F1=0.91 on the intra-subject dataset; and Acc=0.90 and F1=0.90 in the inter-subject one. Moreover, promising results were obtained at both training and testing time using end users׳ data (i.e., people who suffered a stroke). Results at testing time are Acc=0.79 and F1=0.79.
