The COVID-19 pandemic is an acute and rapidly evolving global health crisis. To better understand this disease’s molecular basis and design therapeutic strategies, we built upon the recently proposed concept of an integrated cell, iCell, fusing three omics, tissue-specific human molecular interaction networks. We applied this methodology to construct infected and control iCells using gene expression data from patient samples and three cell lines. We found large differences between patient-based and cell line-based iCells (both infected and control), suggesting that cell lines are ill-suited to studying this disease. We compared patient-based infected and control iCells and uncovered genes whose functioning (wiring patterns in iCells) is altered by the disease. We validated in the literature that 18 out of the top 20 of the most rewired genes are indeed COVID-19-related. Since only three of these genes are targets of approved drugs, we applied another data fusion step to predict drugs for re-purposing. We confirmed with molecular docking that the predicted drugs can bind to their predicted targets. Our most interesting prediction is artenimol, an antimalarial agent targeting ZFP62, one of our newly identified COVID-19-related genes. This drug is a derivative of artemisinin drugs that are already under clinical investigation for their potential role in the treatment of COVID-19. Our results demonstrate further applicability of the iCell framework for integrative comparative studies of human diseases.
